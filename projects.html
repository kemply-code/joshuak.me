      <h1>🧪 Projects</h1>
      <p>These are a few of the things I’ve built, broken, rebuilt, and obsessed over. Some are practical, some are playful — all are part of my journey in learning, exploring, and making life just a little bit better.</p>

      <ul class="projects">
        <li>
          <h2>🗂️ Refile</h2>
          <p><strong>Tech Used:</strong> Python, macOS APIs, LM Studio</p>
          <p>Refile is a clean little macOS app that takes the pain out of messy file names. You drag, drop, and it sorts them using smart rules or even AI-generated naming patterns. I built it because I was drowning in screenshots, school docs, and half-baked filenames like “Screenshot 2025-04-22 at 2.03.04 PM.png” — you know the type.</p>
          <p><em>Why I love it:</em> It was my first time blending UI with AI. I learned heaps about system permissions, file handling, and how to design something that feels truly Mac-native.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>⌨️ Macropad</h2>
          <p><strong>Tech Used:</strong> KiCad, Fusion 360, Arduino</p>
          <p>This little project started as a fun excuse to mess with PCBs and exploded into a full-blown productivity tool. It’s a 6-key custom macropad — 3D-printed case, hot-swappable switches, and all hand-soldered. I use it for everything from opening Spotify to triggering Figma tools with a single click.</p>
          <p><em>Why I love it:</em> It’s tangible. I got to hold something I designed — the plastic, the keys, the lights. There’s magic in that.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>🧠 CS50x Journey</h2>
          <p><strong>Tech Used:</strong> C, Python, HTML/CSS, Git</p>
          <p>Harvard’s CS50 course has been a turning point in how I approach problems. From writing my first line of C to learning how memory really works, it’s given me the foundation I didn’t know I needed. I’m working through the problem sets in my own time, taking notes like a maniac.</p>
          <p><em>Why I love it:</em> It’s not about the certificate — it’s about understanding the building blocks. And getting to say I survived Week 5’s pointers.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>🤖 Robotics (FTC & Beyond)</h2>
          <p><strong>Tech Used:</strong> Onshape, REV robotics system, Java</p>
          <p>I’m part of an FTC robotics team based in Brisbane. We build competitive bots that drive, grab, lift, and sometimes fall over gloriously. It’s fast-paced, collaborative, and has taught me a lot about working under pressure and debugging hardware at the worst possible moment.</p>
          <p><em>Why I love it:</em> The mix of code and chaos. Plus, I love being part of a team where everyone brings a different skill to the table.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>📚 School Experiments</h2>
          <p><strong>Areas:</strong> Science fair projects, tech-integrated learning, debating prep tools</p>
          <p>From sun-tracking hats for skin cancer awareness to mock-ups of educational apps, I’ve built a bunch of smaller projects linked to school. Some were for class, others just sparked from a random “what if?” during lunch break.</p>
          <p><em>Why I love it:</em> These projects often turn into little personal challenges — how can I make something useful with limited time, tools, and sleep?</p>
        </li>
