      <h2>📚 High School Life</h2>
      <p>Right now, I’m fully in the high school zone — classes, assessments, early mornings, and late-night brainstorming. I’m juggling subjects like science, English, and maths (some days more gracefully than others), while trying to dig deeper than just ticking boxes. I like finding the “why” behind things — whether that’s in biology or some abstract English text. I’ve also been exploring how I learn best, and turns out: it’s right after a workout, or when the world’s gone quiet.</p>

      <h2>🧠 Things I’m Learning</h2>
      <p>Outside the classroom, I’m diving into CS50x and learning more about computer science fundamentals — not because I have to, but because I *want* to. I’ve also been exploring how people interact with technology, especially UI design and how good design just makes life feel easier.</p>
      <p>I’ve been slowly improving my coding through little projects — not always flashy — but stuff that solves a problem I’ve run into, or just makes me go, “Hey, that’s neat.”</p>

      <h2>⚙️ Projects & Curiosities</h2>
      <p>One of my recent focuses is <strong>NameFlipper</strong> — a little Mac app I’m building that uses AI to rename files based on their contents. It’s part technical challenge, part design playground. I’m keeping it simple for now, using Python and PyObjC, but dreaming of a sleek native Mac look. Every step is a mix of “what am I doing?” and “this is the best thing ever.”</p>
      <p>I’ve also been experimenting with small electronics and 3D printed tools that improve my everyday setup. Whether it’s a light sensor hat for sun protection or a tiny cable clip I designed on the fly — building things that solve real-world annoyances brings me joy.</p>

      <h2>🎤 Speaking Up</h2>
      <p>Debating has become a big part of my life lately. It’s not just about arguing — it’s about listening, thinking clearly under pressure, and telling stories that stick. I’m currently second speaker for our QDU team and loving the challenge of shaping ideas that matter.</p>

      <h2>🤖 Robotics & Teams</h2>
      <p>I’m involved in an FTC robotics team based in Brisbane, and I get to work with some seriously clever people. It’s been amazing to learn about engineering, coding, teamwork, and just how many ways things can go wrong — and then right again.</p>

      <h2>🌿 What I’m Trying to Do More Of</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Write more — even if it’s just short journal entries or thoughts on tech and design.</li>
        <li>Go outside more — little hikes, walking while listening to podcasts, taking in the sky.</li>
        <li>Be intentional with time — less scrolling, more making.</li>
        <li>Say yes to opportunities that scare me (like public speaking).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>🎧 Lately...</h2>
      <p>Listening to: <em>Instrumental study playlists, F1 race radios, and the occasional lo-fi remix</em>.</p>
      <p>Watching: <em>Formula 1 races, YouTube design breakdowns, and random tech explainers</em>.</p>
      <p>Reading: <em>Science articles, short blogs, and the occasional debate brief</em>.</p>
