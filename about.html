  <h2>my lore</h2>
  <p>born in cambridge, england, 2011. early memories include foggy windows, kettle whistles, and the quiet buzz of curiosity.</p>
  <p>moved to brisbane at 7 — sun was louder, trees taller, accents different. it changed how i saw the world. for the better.</p>

  <h2>how i learn</h2>
  <p>i learn best by doing. repetition, interaction, building. that’s my classroom. my hands teach my brain what lectures can't.</p>

  <h2>my tech journey</h2>
  <p>it started with scratch during the pandemic. evolved into robotics, 3D printing, python, arduino, and then c, html, godot, unity.</p>
  <p>i built my first FLL robot and never looked back — code and circuits became my playground.</p>

  <h2>projects that light me up</h2>
  <p>i’ve built games, AI tools like <strong>nameflipper</strong>, and small daily fixes like 3D-printed cable hooks.</p>
  <p>right now, i’m learning pcb design while building a custom macro pad. it's weirdly thrilling.</p>

  <h2>high school & beyond</h2>
  <p>i don’t hate school — i love when it connects to real life. robotics, debating, and deep dives into how things work.</p>
  <p>not chasing A’s. chasing understanding.</p>

  <h2>interests that spiral</h2>
  <p>i fall into rabbit holes: f1 telemetry, medieval engineering, ethics of AI. if it sparks something in me — i follow it.</p>
  <p>current obsessions: sound systems, html, digital presence, blogging.</p>

  <h2>creativity outside the code</h2>
  <p>i, build, play, soundtrack my days. sometimes it’s a lo-fi playlist, other times it’s digital painting experiments.</p>
  <p>not everything works out — but that’s part of the fun.</p>

  <h2>philosophy of joshua</h2>
  <p>build before you’re ready. share before it’s perfect. learn by doing. and trust that small things grow big over time.</p>

  <h2>why i made this page</h2>
  <p>i made this to connect — not to impress. to share curiosity, creativity, and the weird joy of making things online.</p>
  <p>this site isn’t a portfolio. it’s my corner of the internet where i get to be me.</p>

  <h2>random facts about me</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>i’ve started more projects than i’ve finished. and that’s okay.</li>
    <li>i walk to think. a lot.</li>
    <li>i’ve abseiled into a cave.</li>
  </ul>
