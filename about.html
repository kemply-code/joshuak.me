      <h2>About Me in 10 Minutes</h2>
      <p>Hey there. This isn’t some polished LinkedIn intro. This is the real me — in all my chaotic, creative, learning-as-I-go glory. If we had a coffee and talked for a while, this is what I’d probably say.</p>

      <h3>📍 Origin Story</h3>
      <p>I was born in <strong>Cambridge, England</strong>, in 2011. Some of my earliest memories are oddly vivid: the hum of my mum cooking, foggy windows on cold mornings, the rhythm of British streets, and the warmth of a close-knit home.</p>
      <p>Moving to <strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong> at age 7 shook things up. I remember looking out of the plane, not quite understanding how far away I was going. The air felt different. The sun was louder. But that contrast? It shaped me.</p>

      <h3>🧠 How I Learn</h3>
      <p>I learn by touching stuff. Not literally (okay, sometimes), but through <em>interaction</em>. I have to pull it apart, see how it works, fail a bit, try again, and then — boom — it sticks.</p>
      <p>I carry notebooks, sticky notes, random Google Docs full of half-baked thoughts. I find learning is messier than school makes it seem, but way more fun when it's on your own terms.</p>

    <section class="section">
      <h3>💻 The First Spark</h3>
      <p>I started exploring tech during the COVID lockdowns. I opened up a code editor, poked around HTML, and suddenly — something clicked. That feeling of typing something and seeing it come to life on screen? Addicting.</p>
      <p>I didn’t just stop at websites. I dived into game development with Unity and Godot, learned how computers tick, started designing UIs, and 3D printed things I imagined the night before. To me, tech is a playground for curiosity and creativity.</p>

      <h3>🛠 Projects That Light Me Up</h3>
      <p>Some kids built Lego. I built that too — and then tried to motorise it. I’ve made bird delivery games, AI file renaming tools, debater timers, and robotics projects with my team. I’m not in it for fame — I’m in it for fun. The joy of building something just because I can is magic.</p>
      <p>I also obsess over little “quality-of-life” things. If something annoys me enough times, I try to fix it. A better script, a smarter system, a 3D printed hook for my desk. No problem is too small.</p>

      <h3>🎓 High School & Beyond</h3>
      <p>Yep, I’m in high school. And no, I’m not one of those kids who says “I hate school.” I actually enjoy a lot of it — especially when it intersects with real life. I’m part of my school’s robotics and debating teams, and I love digging into science, tech, and how things work under the hood.</p>
      <p>I don’t just chase A’s. I chase <em>understanding</em>. I chase ideas that keep me up at night.</p>

      <h3>🧠 Interests That Spiral</h3>
      <p>I fall into rabbit holes. Deep ones. One week it’s Formula 1 strategy breakdowns, the next it’s how medieval castles were built or the ethics of AI. I follow my curiosity wherever it wanders.</p>
      <p>Current obsessions: indie game mechanics, tiny house designs, human-computer interaction, and how to make things feel more “real” digitally.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h3>🎨 Creativity Outside the Code</h3>
      <p>I draw, design, tinker, remix. Music plays a huge role in my world — I’m always soundtracking my life (Spotify is my second home). I’ve also started writing a bit more, mostly to make sense of what’s in my head.</p>
      <p>I’ve played with animation, video editing, UI design, and even tried digital painting. Some things turn out bad. Some turn out better than expected. That’s the thrill.</p>

      <h3>🌍 Philosophy of Joshua</h3>
      <p>Build things before you feel ready. Share them before you feel finished. Learn by doing, failing, repeating. And always ask, “What’s one step I can take right now?”</p>
      <p>I’m a big believer in small consistent efforts — tiny seeds that turn into forests over time. And I don’t wait for permission. If something excites me, I go for it.</p>

      <h3>🤝 Why I Made This Page</h3>
      <p>Because sometimes, we scroll past a hundred perfect profiles and still don’t know a person. I want this to be different. I want this to feel like a handshake, a cup of tea, a “hey, I see you.”</p>
      <p>If you're here — maybe you're curious, maybe you're bored, maybe you're a future collaborator. Either way, welcome in.</p>

      <p>This page? Yep — it was written with help from ChatGPT. But every word is still mine. I believe in using tools to express, not replace, your voice.</p>
